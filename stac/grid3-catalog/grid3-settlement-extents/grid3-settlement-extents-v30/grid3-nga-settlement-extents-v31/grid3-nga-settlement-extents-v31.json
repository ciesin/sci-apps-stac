Edits to the data release notes. The GRID3 NGA - Settlement Extents v3.1 include: GRID3_NGA_settlement_extents_v3_1.gpkg : a spatial layer representing settlement polygons. GRID3_NGA_settlement_grid_v3_1.gpkg : a spatial layer representing the centroids of settled grid cells.

    "purpose": "The GRID3 NGA - Settlement Extents v3.1 consists of a geographic representation of settlements in Nigeria, in two forms: 1) settlement polygons, and 2) spatial points depicting the centroids of settled grid cells at 3-arc seconds (or ~100 meters) contained within settlement polygons. Data inputs and methodology are described in the data release notes.",
