    "description": "The two layers contained within the GRID3 BFA - Settlement Extents v3.0 include: GRID3_BFA_settlement_extents_v3.gpkg : a spatial layer representing settlement polygons. GRID3_BFA_settlement_grid_v3.gpkg : a spatial layer representing the centroids of settled grid cells. The current version supersedes GRID3 BFA - Settlement Extents v2.0 ; the following changes were made: Development of a new methodology to derive building counts and settlement polygons with open data. Estimation of a probability value for settlement polygons Addition of a building-area measure Replacement of degree of urbanization with classification based on built-up areas, small settlement areas, and hamlets Elimination of building-count ranges Elimination of variable comparing to previous versions For more information on data inputs, methodology, and codebooks please see the Data Release Notes .

    "purpose": "The GRID3 BFA - Settlement Extents v3.0 consists of a geographic representation of settlements in Burkina Faso, in two forms: 1) settlement polygons, and 2) spatial points depicting the centroids of settled grid cells at 3-arc seconds (or ~100 meters) contained within settlement polygons. Both layers include attributes as described in the codebooks. Data inputs and methodology are described in data release notes.",
